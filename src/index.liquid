      The current web works by having companies set up servers which host people's websites and data.
      This means that if a company goes down, or if a person doesn't have access to their server
      (say they're offline, behind a firewall, or can't afford a decent connection) they can't access it.
      This also means that not everybody can publish things since it takes a lot of technical know-how
      to host things that they can have full control over.
      The distributed web works by removing central web servers and instead using Peer to Peer
      connections directly between people to load data.</p>

      <p class="pl1 pr1 f4 mb5 pa3 lh-copy mt0-ns near-white tl" id="hello">

      If you want to create something,
      you serve it directly from your computer, and when somebody downloads their content
      they will also re-share it. The more people load some data, the more resilient it is and
      the faster it can be downloaded. As well, once you've loaded some data over the distributed web,
      you no longer need to be connected to the internet to access it.
      In fact, if you have a bunch of people connected to a wifi router in the middle of nowhere,
      your peer to peer apps will all keep working.</p>
